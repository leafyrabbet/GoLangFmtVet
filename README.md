## Usage

Use the command-palette (`CMD+SHIFT+p` or `CTRL+SHIFT+p`) and look for `GoLangFmtVet` to see the available commands that can be used on the current file you have open.

_Note: The intended design is to have this run whenever saving a file, but there are some minor annoyances when doing that, currently, so it has been disabled for the time being._
